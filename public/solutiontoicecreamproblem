        // JavaScript code goes here
//         An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. 
// Write a JS program that generates a random number between 
// 50 and 100 representing the amount of cones to sell. Your code 
// should generate numbers between 1 and 5, simulating the amount of 
// cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the 
// console the amount of cones sold to each person. This is how you get 
// the random numbers.

// // This is how you get a random number between 50 and 100
// var allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
// // This is how you get a random number between 1 and 5
// var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
// The output should be similar to the following:

// 5 cones sold...  // if there are enough cones
// Cannot sell you 6 cones I only have 3...  // If there are not enough cones
// Yay! I sold them all! // If there are no more cones
