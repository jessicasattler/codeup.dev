Passing Data with a GET request

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=codeup
the question mark is the start of something called a query string. The query string allows additional key-value pairs to be passed along to the receiving end of the GET request. 

Passing More Than One Key-Value Pair

What if you need to pass multiple values? That would look like this:

http://example.com/index.php?var1=value1&var2=value2&var3=value3

Additional key-value pairs after the first get separated by an amepersand (&). You can add as many of these pairs as you need.
