#Pattern for setting up a problem:
process of visualization
input ->process ->output

read the exercise
what's the real problem?
What's the output that we are tyring to produce?
What's the given input?
What are the other specifications, validation?
attention to detail, spotting differences
Do we have input that is provided?
eliminate what is not relevant

take notes of what you want the code to do, where, in what order 


figure out variables
	-what stuff changes (what inputs need to be worked on)
	-what stuff gets repeated (strings in the output)
	-what stuff stays the same just once
	-naming the nouns (the more you can break down the problem in normal English and writing down how to set up the problem)
			-subtotal
			-taxAmount
			-discountPercentage
			-finalTotal
			-taxPercentage
(write all the nouns that are in the exercises, not all will be variables but the ones we see over and over again, we will have different named variables)
name things exactly what they are

Write out pseudocode (mainly in comments)

	-defining inputs
	-try out variable names (expect that they might change)
	-defining process
		-what verbs (functions such as .toUpperCase or console.log) need to happen to what nouns
		-what does each verb do to each noun
		-what's the order of the verb
		-after a verb happens to a noun, does that mean we need a new known name to hold the result
	-making your output match the specification 
	-do we need a loop? does the loop need to happen at least once?

code small changes
start converting tiny pieces of pseudocode into real code, take it from the top
//loop until you generate a random number that is odd
does it make sense?
revisit variable (and function names) to see if they make sense

make small working pieces

use small working pieces in larger solutions

##Debugging
"use strinct" at the top of your script 
double check file paths 
did you move the file while working on it, and you're editing one file while testing a different copy in the browser?
double check your link paths
bring up your javascript console to look for syntax errors  or 404s

coding without a plan is not the best way to proceed
try small things
change only one thing
what was expected vs. actual result
change it back , try something different
hold as many things constant as possible == comment stuff out that you are not using
console.log all the things (or you'll be flying blind)
