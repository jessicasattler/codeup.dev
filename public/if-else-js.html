// HEB has an offer for the clients that buy products amounting more than $200. The discount is 35% off the purchase. Write a JS program, using conditionals, that logs to the browser, how much Ryan, Cameron and George need to pay. We know that Cameron bought $180, Ryan $250 and George $320. Your program will have to display a line with the name of the person, the amount before the discount, if any, and the amount after the discount. The output of your code should be similar to the following one:
// Luis bought $100.00, no discount was applied. Final payment: $100.00.
// Zach bought $220.00, discount was applied. Final payment: $143.00.
 // Growth: do something similar to Cameron as to Ryan and George, make code work no matter what the amounts puchased were and do else for all three in case the amount required for discount increases or decreases. Use as many variables as possible. 
 // var purchaseOfCameron = 180
 // var purchaseOfRyan = 250
 // var purchaseOfGeorge = 320
 // var totalPrice;


 	// if (purchaseOfCameron < 200){
 	// 	console.log ("Cameron bought $180, no discount was applied.");
 	// } 

 	// else { console.log("Cameron received the discount")
 	// }


 	// if (purchaseOfRyan > 200){
 	// 	totalPrice = purchaseOfRyan - (purchaseOfRyan * 0.35); 
 	// 	console.log ("Ryan bought " + purchaseOfRyan + " discount was applied. Total purchase is " + totalPrice)
 	// }

 	// if (purchaseOfGeorge > 200) {
 	// 	totalPrice = purchaseOfGeorge - (purchaseOfGeorge * 0.35);
 	// 	console.log ("George bought " + purchaseOfGeorge + "discount was applied. Total purchase is " + totalPrice)
 	// }
